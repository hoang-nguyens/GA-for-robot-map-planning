## Activation
Genetic Algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by process of natural selection and genetics. They work by evolving a population of candidate solutions through operations such as selection, crossover and mutation. Over successive generations, these algorithms explore and exploit the solution space to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems.
