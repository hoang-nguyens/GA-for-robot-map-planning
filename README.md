## Activation
Genetic Algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by process of natural selection and genetics. They work by evolving a population of candidate solutions through operations such as selection, crossover and mutation. Over successive generations, these algorithms explore and exploit the solution space to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems.

## How to use 
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Shortcut Keys:</span></p>
<p>Ctrl + L: Enter the map's name to load an existing grid map.<br>
Ctrl + A: Enter the map's name to open an existing map and solve for the path.<br>
Ctrl + S: Save your current map.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 20px;">To Create a New Map:</span></p>
<p>Mouse + Shift: Select a cell to set as the starting point.<br>
Mouse + Ctrl: Select a cell to set as the target point.<br>
Mouse Click: Select a cell to place an obstacle.</p>
